Overview
========

[OpenSceneGraph](http://openscenegraph.org) is an open source high performance
3D graphics toolkit, used by application developers in fields such as visual
simulation, games, virtual reality, scientific visualization and modelling.

It uses OpenGL (including ES) to perform 3D rendering.

This guide explains how to render a simple 3D model using OpenSceneGraph
under the following platforms:

1. Linux
1. macOS
1. Windows
1. Android
1. iOS
1. Web

Continuous numbering convention
===============================

This guide uses continuous numbering with topics denoted as
**Number1**.**Number2** (e.g., **1.1**) and concrete steps denoted as
**Number1**.**Number2**.**Number3** (e.g., **1.1.1**).

Here's what each number means:

1. **Number1** is the guide number. In our case, it's the first guide, so it's **1**.
1. **Number2** is a specific topic. In the case of creating a cube, it's **1.1**.
1. **Number3** is a concrete step of the topic. In the case of installing Blender, it's **1.1.1**.

### [1.1. Create a cube](1.1.CreateCube)

  ![Screenshot](readme/1.1.cube.png)

  We create a simple cube that OpenSceneGraph will render later.

### [1.2. Install OpenSceneGraph under Linux](1.2.InstallUnderLinux)

  ![Screenshot](readme/1.2.install_under_linux.png)

  We install OpenSceneGraph under Linux and take a look at the cube
  with **osgviewer** tool.

### [1.3. Install OpenSceneGraph under Windows](1.3.InstallUnderWindows)

  ![Screenshot](readme/1.3.install_under_windows.png)

  We install OpenSceneGraph under Windows and take a look at the cube
  with **osgviewer** tool.
